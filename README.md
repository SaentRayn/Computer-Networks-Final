# Computer-Networks-Final

## Secondary Educational Experience
There are two main folders for the final the ws-chat being a simple server/"client" program started on a WebSocket. This is straght from the javascript/websocket site and served as a basis for the beginning of my project. It doesn't attribute as much to a dedicated client or actual client base as expected so it was a beginning to learn js and how the socket works.

I can be cloned, and then an npm install and then ran for the chat at the localhost.com/8080 for experience but is not the main portion of my implementation and experiementation for the final.

## The Main Project Worked

Most of my time was spent learning and understanding js through the socket.io. Following the guide to the socket.io implementation and it's guide for the chat implementation, I started with the chat serer and worked on creating a client base for the connections and then started implementing RPS. I have an idea for finishing the experience for RPS with the saved client socket id/nicknames but have it set to auto play against the computer which randomly chooses a R/P/S.

For running this portion the js and html file can be cloned, the necessary npm's may need to be installed and then the js file is run which will open a server at the localhost.com/8080. There isn't a dedicated client file for this yet as it will be served on the site for localhost until I finish the RPS implementation.

I plan to continue working on this project well past the semester ends. I hope whenever the user finds this that it is complete and a much more enjoyable expirience then initially posted.
